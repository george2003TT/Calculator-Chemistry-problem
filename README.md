#About Theory
The position of the sun can be calculated using a variety of astronomical formulas and models. The most commonly used model for calculating the sun's position is the solar ephemeris, which predicts the sun's position in the sky at a particular location and time.

The calculations are based on a number of parameters such as the observer's latitude and longitude, the date and time, and the solar declination and hour angle.

The solar declination is the angle between the rays of the sun and the plane of the earth's equator. It varies between -23.5 degrees and 23.5 degrees, with a maximum value at the summer solstice and a minimum value at the winter solstice.

The solar hour angle is the angle between the observer's meridian (a line connecting the observer's location to the North and South poles) and the line connecting the observer's location to the sun. It varies between -90 and 90 degrees, with a maximum value at solar noon and a minimum value at solar midnight.

Using the solar declination and hour angle, the solar zenith angle (SZA) can be calculated, which is the angle between the rays of the sun and a line perpendicular to the observer's horizon.

Finally, the solar elevation angle (SEA) can be calculated as the difference between 90 degrees and the SZA. The SEA gives an idea of how much solar radiation is received by a surface at a particular location and time.

It's important to note that this is just a rough approximation, the sun's position can be affected by many factors such as atmospheric refraction and the observer's altitude. A more accurate solar position calculation would need to take into account of the observer's altitude, atmospheric refraction and other effects on the light path
